ðŸ”¹ Task 1 Completed â€“ Tic Tac Toe Game in Python ðŸ”¹

As part of my 2-Months internship at Digital Bhem as a Python Programming Intern, I successfully completed Task 1, which involved creating a fully functional Tic Tac Toe game using Python.

 What I Did:
 Created a 3x3 grid to represent the game board using a Python list.

 Developed a function to display the board dynamically after each move.

 Implemented turn-based logic allowing two players to input their moves using 'X' and 'O'.

 Added logic to check for winning conditions or a tie after every move.

 Included the option for players to restart the game after it ends.

 Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of conditional logic, loops, functions, and interactive user input in Python.

 Iâ€™ve also uploaded a screen recording demonstration of the game in action, showcasing the gameplay flow and functionality.

 

 Outcome:
A fully interactive terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game that supports two-player mode, detects wins and ties, handles invalid inputs, and restarts cleanly. This task gave me hands-on experience with Python fundamentals and improved my coding logic through a fun project.
